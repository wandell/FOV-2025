  abstract = {Robust three-dimensional scene understanding is now an ever-growing area of research highly relevant in many real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning-based model capable of performing two tasks:- sparse depth completion (i.e. generating complete dense scene depth given a sparse depth image as the input) and monocular depth estimation (i.e. predicting scene depth from a single RGB image) via two sub-networks jointly trained end to end using data randomly sampled from a publicly available corpus of synthetic and real-world images. The first sub-network generates a sparse depth image by learning lower level features from the scene and the second predicts a full dense depth image of the entire scene, leading to a better geometric and contextual understanding of the scene and, as a result, superior performance of the approach. The entire model can be used to infer complete scene depth from a single RGB image or the second network can be used alone to perform depth completion given a sparse depth input. Using adversarial training, a robust objective function, a deep architecture relying on skip connections and a blend of synthetic and real-world training data, our approach is capable of producing superior high quality scene depth. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of our approach compared to contemporary state-of-the-art techniques across both problem domains.}

To overcome this challenge, deep learning-based depth completion algorithms have been developed to inpaint missing depth guided by an RGB image. However, these methods fail for low sampling rates. Here, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme for LiDAR systems that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for depth completion at low sampling rates. Our system is fully differentiable, allowing the sparse depth sampling and the depth inpainting components to be trained end-to-end with an upstream task.},

Our water model includes parameters for the type and amount of phytoplankton, the concentration of chlorophyll, the amount of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and the concentration of detritus (non-algal particles, NAP). We show that by adjusting the model parameters, we can predict real sensor data captured by a digital camera at a fixed distance and depth from a reference target with known spectral reflectance. We also provide an open-source implementation of all our tools and simulations.},

The presented software simulator SENSOR (Software Environment for the Simulation of Optical Remote sensing systems) includes a full model of the sensor hardware, the observed scene, and the atmosphere in between. The simulator consists of three parts. The first part describes the geometrical relations between scene, sun, and the remote sensing system using a ray-tracing algorithm. The second part of the simulation environment considers the radiometry. It calculates the at-sensor radiance using a pre-calculated multidimensional lookup-table taking the atmospheric influence on the radiation into account. The third part consists of an optical and an electronic sensor model for the generation of digital images. Using SENSOR for an optimisation requires the additional application of task-specific data processing algorithms. The principle of the end-to-end-simulation approach is explained, all relevant concepts of SENSOR are discussed, and first examples of its use are given. The verification of SENSOR is demonstrated. This work is closely related to the Airborne PRISM Experiment (APEX), an airborne imaging spectrometer funded by the European Space Agency.},

  abstract = {In this work, a deep learning approach has been developed to carry out road detection by fusing LIDAR point clouds and camera images. An unstructured and sparse point cloud is first projected onto the camera image plane and then upsampled to obtain a set of dense 2D images encoding spatial information. Several fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) are then trained to carry out road detection, either by using data from a single sensor, or by using three fusion strategies: early, late, and the newly proposed cross fusion. Whereas in the former two fusion approaches, the integration of multimodal information is carried out at a predefined depth level, the cross fusion FCN is designed to directly learn from data where to integrate information; this is accomplished by using trainable cross connections between the LIDAR and the camera processing branches. To further highlight the benefits of using a multimodal system for road detection, a data set consisting of visually challenging scenes was extracted from driving sequences of the KITTI raw data set. It was then demonstrated that, as expected, a purely camera-based FCN severely underperforms on this data set. A multimodal system, on the other hand, is still able to provide high accuracy. Finally, the proposed cross fusion FCN was evaluated on the KITTI road benchmark where it achieved excellent performance, with a MaxF score of 96.03\%, ranking it among the top-performing approaches.},

  abstract = {A digital camera is a complex system including a lens, a sensor (physics and circuits), and a digital image processor, where each component is a sophisticated system on its own. Since prototyping a digital camera is very expensive, it is highly desirable to have the capability to explore the system design tradeoffs and preview the system output ahead of time. An empirical digital imaging system simulation that aims to achieve such a goal is presented. It traces the photons reflected by the objects in a scene through the optics and color filter array, converts photons into electrons with consideration of noise introduced by the system, quantizes the accumulated voltage to digital counts by an analog-to-digital converter, and generates a Bayer raw image just as a real camera does. The simulated images are validated against real system outputs and show a close resemblance to the images captured under similar condition at all illumination levels.},

Procedures are now available to simulate complex environments including occluded and textured surfaces. For accurate rendering, the environment must be discretized into a fine mesh, particularly in areas of high intensity gradients. The interdependence between surfaces implies solution techniques which are computationally intractable. This article describes new procedures to predict the global illumination function without excessive computational expense. Statistics indicate the enormous potential of this approach for realistic image synthesis, particularly for dynamic images of static environments.},

First, it accepts a physical description of a given scene and simulates the entire process of photon sensing and charge generation in the sensor device. This process is affected by noise, mostly photon noise. Second, it adds to the image the noise that results from the electronic circuitry. We present a model for the different sources of noise relative to each sensor-based image formation step, and use measurements of real digital camera images to validate the model.},

  abstract = {Deep networks have been used for semantic segmentation tasks on scenes of outdoor environments with increasing popularity. However, the majority of existing work centers on daytime scenes with favorable illumination and weather conditions, and relies on supervision with pixel-level annotations. This paper seeks to address the problem of semantic segmentation for rainy, night-time scenes without using pixel-level annotations. We introduce a near scene semantic approach that uses images of daytime scenes as a bridge for transferring knowledge from pre-trained segmentation models to rainy night images. Specifically, we first present near scene oriented Representation Adaptation (RA) to reduce the domain shift on the representation level. Next, we adapt the segmentation model from the daytime scenario, under varying weather conditions, to the rainy night scenario by using near scene oriented Segmentation Space Adaptation (SSA). Consequently, this further reduces the impact of the domain shift on the segmentation space level. For evaluation, we created a new dataset containing 7000 distinct daytime-night-time image pairs of near scenes obtained by a webcam, and 5266 daytime-rainy night image pairs collected by a car-mounted camera. In addition, we carefully annotated 226 rainy night images with classes defined in Cityscapes. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Systems and methods are described that relate to a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) device. The LIDAR device includes a fiber laser configured to emit light within a wavelength range, a scanning portion configured to direct the emitted light in a reciprocating manner about a first axis, and a plurality of detectors configured to sense light within the wavelength range. The device additionally includes a controller configured to receive target information, which may be indicative of an object, a position, a location, or an angle range. In response to receiving the target information, the controller may cause the rotational mount to rotate so as to adjust a pointing direction of the LIDAR. The controller is further configured to cause the LIDAR to scan a field-of-view (FOV) of the environment. The controller may determine a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the environment based on data from scanning the FOV.}

We compare the simulations of specific targets to measured data for several different imaging sensors with very different imaging properties. The simulation captures the essential features of the images created by these different sensors. Finally, we show that by specifying the sensor properties the simulations can predict sensor performance to natural scenes that are difficult to measure with a laboratory apparatus, such as natural scenes with high dynamic range or low light levels.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in perception for autonomous driving are driven by deep learning. In order to achieve robust and accurate scene understanding, autonomous vehicles are usually equipped with different sensors (e.g. cameras, LiDARs, Radars), and multiple sensing modalities can be fused to exploit their complementary properties. In this context, many methods have been proposed for deep multi-modal perception problems. However, there is no general guideline for network architecture design, and questions of ``what to fuse'', ``when to fuse'', and ``how to fuse'' remain open. This review paper attempts to systematically summarize methodologies and discuss challenges for deep multi-modal object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To this end, we first provide an overview of on-board sensors on test vehicles, open datasets, and background information for object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving research. We then summarize the fusion methodologies and discuss challenges and open questions. In the appendix, we provide tables that summarize topics and methods. We also provide an interactive online platform to navigate each reference: https://boschresearch.github.io/multimodalperception/.}

The high-speed and high-resolution pattern projection capability offered by the digital light projection technology, together with the recent advances in imaging sensor technologies, may enable new generation systems for 3D surface measurement applications that will provide much better functionality and performance than existing ones in terms of speed, accuracy, resolution, modularization, and ease of use. Performance indexes of 3D imaging system are discussed, and various 3D surface imaging schemes are categorized, illustrated, and compared. Calibration techniques are also discussed, since they play critical roles in achieving the required precision. Numerous applications of 3D surface imaging technologies are discussed with several examples.},

  abstract = {Rapid advances in 2D perception have led to systems that accurately detect objects in real-world images. However, these systems make predictions in 2D, ignoring the 3D structure of the world. Concurrently, advances in 3D shape prediction have mostly focused on synthetic benchmarks and isolated objects. We unify advances in these two areas. We propose a system that detects objects in real-world images and produces a triangle mesh giving the full 3D shape of each detected object. Our system, called Mesh R-CNN, augments Mask R-CNN with a mesh prediction branch that outputs meshes with varying topological structure by first predicting coarse voxel representations which are converted to meshes and refined with a graph convolution network operating over the mesh's vertices and edges. We validate our mesh prediction branch on ShapeNet, where we outperform prior work on single-image shape prediction. We then deploy our full Mesh R-CNN system on Pix3D, where we jointly detect objects and predict their 3D shapes.}

Our system is a single-chip solution based on a special CMOS pixel structure that can extract phase information from the received light pulses. The sensor chip integrates a 64x64 pixel array with a high-speed clock generator and ADC. A unique advantage of the chip is that it can be manufactured with an ordinary CMOS process. Compared with other types of depth sensors reported in the literature, our solution offers significant advantages, including superior accuracy, high frame rate, cost effectiveness and a drastic reduction in processing required to construct the depth maps. We explain the factors that determine the resolution of our system, discuss various problems that a time-of-flight depth sensor might face, and propose practical solutions.},

Current light reflection models used in computer graphics do not account for the object-to-object reflection between diffuse surfaces, and thus incorrectly compute the global illumination effects. The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the ``color-bleeding'' effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources. The resultant surface intensities are independent of observer position, and thus environments can be preprocessed for dynamic sequences.},

This is why the development of realistic numerical models enabling to substitute real truth by simulated truth is primordial. In order to provide an accurate and cost effective solution to simulate real optical sensor behavior, the software Pro-SiVIC™ has been developed. Simulations with the software Pro-SiVIC™ can replace real tests with optical sensors and hence allow substantial cost and time savings during the development of solutions for driver assistance systems. An optical platform has been developed by IFSTTAR (French Institute of Science and Technology for Transport, Development and Networks) to characterize and validate any existing camera, in order to measure their characteristics as distortion, vignetting, focal length, etc. By comparing real and simulated sensors with this platform, this paper demonstrates that Pro-SiVIC™ accurately reproduces real sensors' behavior.},

  abstract = {We present an imaging framework which converts three images from a gated camera into high-resolution depth maps with depth accuracy comparable to pulsed lidar measurements. Existing scanning lidar systems achieve low spatial resolution at large ranges due to mechanically-limited angular sampling rates, restricting scene understanding tasks to close-range clusters with dense sampling. Moreover, today's pulsed lidar scanners suffer from high cost, power consumption, large form-factors, and they fail in the presence of strong backscatter. We depart from point scanning and demonstrate that it is possible to turn a low-cost CMOS gated imager into a dense depth camera with at least 80m range - by learning depth from three gated images. The proposed architecture exploits semantic context across gated slices, and is trained on a synthetic discriminator loss without the need of dense depth labels. The proposed replacement for scanning lidar systems is real-time, handles back-scatter and provides dense depth at long ranges. We validate our approach in simulation and on real-world data acquired over 4,000km driving in northern Europe. Data and code are available at https://github.com/gruberto/Gated2Depth.}

  abstract = {In the early design stages of embedded applications, it becomes necessary to have a very realistic simulation environment dedicated to the prototyping and to the evaluation of these Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). This Numerical simulation stage is gradually becoming a strong advantage in active safety. The use of realistic numerical models enabling to substitute real data by simulated data is primordial. For such virtual platform it is mandatory to provide physics-driven road environments, virtual embedded sensors, and physics-based vehicle models. In this publication, a generic solution for cameras modelling is presented. The use of this optical sensor simulation can easily and efficiently replace real camera test campaigns. This optical sensor is very important due to the great number of applications and algorithms based on it. The presented model involves a filter mechanism in order to reproduce, in the most realistic way, the behaviour of optical sensors. The main filters used in ADAS developments will be presented. Moreover, an optical analysis of these virtual sensors has been achieved allowing the confrontation between real and simulated results. An optical platform has been developed to characterize and validate any camera, permitting to measure their performances. By comparing real and simulated sensors with this platform, this paper demonstrates this virtual platform (Pro-SiVIC™) accurately reproduces real optical sensors' behaviour.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of object detection for RGB-D images using semantically rich image and depth features. We propose a new geocentric embedding for depth images that encodes height above ground and angle with gravity for each pixel in addition to the horizontal disparity. We demonstrate that this geocentric embedding works better than using raw depth images for learning feature representations with convolutional neural networks. Our final object detection system achieves an average precision of 37.3\%, which is a 56\% relative improvement over existing methods. We then focus on the task of instance segmentation where we label pixels belonging to object instances found by our detector. For this task, we propose a decision forest approach that classifies pixels in the detection window as foreground or background using a family of unary and binary tests that query shape and geocentric pose features. Finally, we use the output from our object detectors in an existing superpixel classification framework for semantic scene segmentation and achieve a 24\% relative improvement over current state-of-the-art for the object categories that we study. We believe advances such as those represented in this paper will facilitate the use of perception in fields like robotics.}

  abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of semantic labeling of indoor scenes on RGB-D data. With the availability of RGB-D cameras, it is expected that additional depth measurement will improve the accuracy. Here we investigate a solution how to incorporate complementary depth information into a semantic segmentation framework by making use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently encoder-decoder type fully convolutional CNN architectures have achieved a great success in the field of semantic segmentation. Motivated by this observation we propose an encoder-decoder type network, where the encoder part is composed of two branches of networks that simultaneously extract features from RGB and depth images and fuse depth features into the RGB feature maps as the network goes deeper. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed fusion-based architecture achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging SUN RGB-D benchmark obtaining 76.27\% global accuracy , 48.30\% average class accuracy and 37.29\% average intersection-over-union score.}

  abstract = {We present our third prototype sensor and a localization method for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), for which small imaging LIght Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and fusion-based localization are fundamentally important. Our small imaging LIDAR, named the Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) LIDAR, uses a time-of-flight method and SPAD arrays. A SPAD is a highly sensitive photodetector capable of detecting at the single-photon level, and the SPAD LIDAR has two SPAD arrays on the same chip for detection of laser light and environmental light. Therefore, the SPAD LIDAR simultaneously outputs range image data and monocular image data with the same coordinate system and does not require external calibration among outputs. As AGVs travel both indoors and outdoors with vibration, this calibration-less structure is particularly useful for AGV applications. We also introduce a fusion-based localization method, named SPAD DCNN, which uses the SPAD LIDAR and employs a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). SPAD DCNN can fuse the outputs of the SPAD LIDAR: range image data, monocular image data and peak intensity image data. The SPAD DCNN has two outputs: the regression result of the position of the SPAD LIDAR and the classification result of the existence of a target to be approached. Our third prototype sensor and the localization method are evaluated in an indoor environment by assuming various AGV trajectories. The results show that the sensor and localization method improve the localization accuracy.},

While ToF sensors are well documented, few, if any, monolithic sensors have been reported that capture both range and color. In one sensor, a combined pixel structure captures color and range, but presumably in sequential fields. This approach does not allow simultaneous capturing of range with color, and the pixel performance cannot be optimized for each mode. In thie paper, we introduce a sensor that is designed to capture color and range simultaneously with individually optimized pixels.},

  abstract = {Because intelligent surveillance systems have recently undergone rapid growth, research on accurately detecting humans in videos captured at a long distance is growing in importance. The existing research using visible light cameras has mainly focused on methods of human detection for daytime hours when there is outside light, but human detection during nighttime hours when there is no outside light is difficult. Thus, methods that employ additional near-infrared (NIR) illuminators and NIR cameras or thermal cameras have been used. However, in the case of NIR illuminators, there are limitations in terms of the illumination angle and distance. There are also difficulties because the illuminator power must be adaptively adjusted depending on whether the object is close or far away. In the case of thermal cameras, their cost is still high, which makes it difficult to install and use them in a variety of places. Because of this, research has been conducted on nighttime human detection using visible light cameras, but this has focused on objects at a short distance in an indoor environment or the use of video-based methods to capture multiple images and process them, which causes problems related to the increase in the processing time. To resolve these problems, this paper presents a method that uses a single image captured at night on a visible light camera to detect humans in a variety of environments based on a convolutional neural network. Experimental results using a self-constructed Dongguk night-time human detection database (DNHD-DB1) and two open databases (Korea advanced institute of science and technology (KAIST) and computer vision center (CVC) databases), as well as high-accuracy human detection in a variety of environments, show that the method has excellent performance compared to existing methods.},

  abstract = {The fusion of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and camera data in real-time is known to be a crucial process in many applications, such as in autonomous driving, industrial automation, and robotics. Especially in the case of autonomous vehicles, the efficient fusion of data from these two types of sensors is important to enabling the depth of objects as well as the detection of objects at short and long distances. As both the sensors are capable of capturing the different attributes of the environment simultaneously, the integration of those attributes with an efficient fusion approach greatly benefits the reliable and consistent perception of the environment. This paper presents a method to estimate the distance (depth) between a self-driving car and other vehicles, objects, and signboards on its path using the accurate fusion approach. Based on the geometrical transformation and projection, low-level sensor fusion was performed between a camera and LiDAR using a 3D marker. Further, the fusion information is utilized to estimate the distance of objects detected by the RefineDet detector. Finally, the accuracy and performance of the sensor fusion and distance estimation approach were evaluated in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis by considering real road and simulation environment scenarios. Thus the proposed low-level sensor fusion, based on the computational geometric transformation and projection for object distance estimation proves to be a promising solution for enabling reliable and consistent environment perception ability for autonomous vehicles.},

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles rely on perception systems to understand their surroundings for further navigation missions. Cameras are essential for perception systems due to the advantages of object detection and recognition provided by modern computer vision algorithms, comparing to other sensors, such as LiDARs and radars. However, limited by its inherent imaging principle, a standard RGB camera may perform poorly in a variety of adverse scenarios, including but not limited to: low illumination, high contrast, bad weather such as fog/rain/snow, etc. Meanwhile, estimating the 3D information from the 2D image detection is generally more difficult when compared to LiDARs or radars. Several new sensing technologies have emerged in recent years to address the limitations of conventional RGB cameras. In this paper, we review the principles of four novel image sensors: infrared cameras, range-gated cameras, polarization cameras, and event cameras. Their comparative advantages, existing or potential applications, and corresponding data processing algorithms are all presented in a systematic manner. We expect that this study will assist practitioners in the autonomous driving society with new perspectives and insights.}

  abstract = {Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a sparse depth input. The acquisition of dense ground truth annotations for depth completion settings can be difficult and, at the same time, a significant domain gap between real LiDAR measurements and synthetic data has prevented from successful training of models in virtual settings. We propose a domain adaptation approach for sparse-to-dense depth completion that is trained from synthetic data, without annotations in the real domain or additional sensors. Our approach simulates the real sensor noise in an RGB+LiDAR set-up, and consists of three modules: simulating the real LiDAR input in the synthetic domain via projections, filtering the real noisy LiDAR for supervision and adapting the synthetic RGB image using a CycleGAN approach. We extensively evaluate these modules against the state-of-the-art in the KITTI depth completion benchmark, showing significant improvements.}

Our software includes a 3D model of the oral cavity and excitation-emission matrices of endogenous fluorophores that predict the spectral radiance of oral mucosal tissue. The predicted radiance is transformed by a model of the optics and image sensor to generate expected sensor image values. We compare simulated and real camera data from tongues in healthy individuals and show that the camera sensor chromaticity values can be used to quantify the fluorescence from porphyrins relative to the bulk fluorescence from multiple fluorophores (elastin, NADH, FAD, and collagen). Validation of the simulations supports the use of soft-prototyping in guiding system design for fluorescence imaging.},

To realize this potential, it is necessary to build trust in physics-based end-to-end image systems simulations. Toward this goal, we describe and experimentally validate an end-to-end physics-based image systems simulation of a digital camera. The simulation models the spectral radiance of 3-D scenes, the formation of the spectral irradiance by multielement optics, and the conversion of the irradiance to digital values (DVs) by the image sensor. We quantify the accuracy of the simulation by comparing real and simulated images of a precisely constructed, 3-D high-dynamic range (HDR) test scene.},

The method makes use of synthetic reference data generated by an observational model that is able to simulate the response of the selected optical inspection system to the ideal structure, thereby providing an ideal measure of deviation from nominal geometry. The method addresses the high dynamic range challenge faced in highly parallel manufacturing by enabling the use of low resolution, wide field of view optical systems for defect detection on surfaces containing small features over large regions.},

Indeed, depth sensing is easily acquired using depth cameras such as a Kinect or stereo setups. We investigate the optimal manner to perform this sensor fusion with a special focus on lightweight single-pass convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, enabling real-time processing on limited hardware. For this, we implement a network architecture allowing us to parameterize at which network layer both information sources are fused together. We performed exhaustive experiments to determine the optimal fusion point in the network, from which we can conclude that fusing towards the mid to late layers provides the best results. Our best fusion models significantly outperform the baseline RGB network in both accuracy and localization of the detections.},

  abstract = {Detection and neutralization of surface-laid and buried landmines has been a slow and dangerous endeavor for military forces and humanitarian organizations throughout the world. In an effort to make the process faster and safer, scientists have begun to exploit the ever-evolving passive electro-optical realm, both from a broadband perspective and a multi or hyperspectral perspective. Carried with this exploitation is the development of mine detection algorithms that take advantage of spectral features exhibited by mine targets, only available in a multi or hyperspectral data set. Difficulty in algorithm development arises from a lack of robust data, which is needed to appropriately test the validity of an algorithm's results. This paper discusses the development of synthetic data using the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) model. A synthetic landmine scene has been modeled after data collected at a US Army arid testing site by the University of Hawaii's Airborne Hyperspectral Imager (AHI). The synthetic data has been created and validated to represent the surrogate minefield thermally, spatially, spectrally, and temporally over the 7.9 to 11.5 micron region using 70 bands of data. Validation of the scene has been accomplished by direct comparison to the AHI truth data using qualitative band to band visual analysis, Rank Order Correlation comparison, Principle Components dimensionality analysis, and an evaluation of the R(x) algorithm's performance. This paper discusses landmine detection phenomenology, describes the steps taken to build the scene, modeling methods utilized to overcome input parameter limitations, and compares the synthetic scene to truth data.},

  abstract = {Variants of accuracy and precision are the gold-standard by which the computer vision community measures progress of perception algorithms. One reason for the ubiquity of these metrics is that they are largely task-agnostic; we in general seek to detect zero false negatives or positives. The downside of these metrics is that, at worst, they penalize all incorrect detections equally without conditioning on the task or scene, and at best, heuristics need to be chosen to ensure that different mistakes count differently. In this paper, we propose a principled metric for 3D object detection specifically for the task of self-driving. The core idea behind our metric is to isolate the task of object detection and measure the impact the produced detections would induce on the downstream task of driving. Without hand-designing it to, we find that our metric penalizes many of the mistakes that other metrics penalize by design. In addition, our metric downweighs detections based on additional factors such as distance from a detection to the ego car and the speed of the detection in intuitive ways that other detection metrics do not. For human evaluation, we generate scenes in which standard metrics and our metric disagree and find that humans side with our metric 79\% of the time.

  abstract = {We investigate the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) at detecting a signal-known-exactly in Poisson noise. We compare the network performance with that of a Bayesian ideal observer (IO) that has the theoretical optimum in detection performance and a linear support vector machine (SVM). For several types of stimuli, including harmonics, faces, and certain regular patterns, the CNN performance asymptotes at the level of the IO. The SVM detection sensitivity is approximately 3-times lower. For other stimuli, including random patterns and certain cellular automata, the CNN sensitivity is significantly lower than that of the IO and the SVM. Finally, when the signal can appear in one of multiple locations, CNN sensitivity continues to match the ideal sensitivity.}

  abstract = {Object detectors are central to autonomous driving and are widely used in driver assistance systems. Object detectors are trained on a finite amount of data within a specific domain, hampering detection performance when applying object detectors to samples from other domains during inference, an effect known as domain gap. Domain gap is a concern for data-driven applications, evoking repetitive retraining of networks when the applications unfold into other domains. With object detectors that have been trained on day images only, a domain gap can be observed in object detection by night. Training object detectors on night images is critical because of the enormous effort required to generate an adequate amount of diversely labeled data, and existing data sets often tend to overfit specific domain characteristics. For the first time, this work proposes adapting domains by online image-to-image translation to expand an object detector's domain of operation. The domain gap is decreased without additional labeling effort and without having to retrain the object detector while unfolding into the target domain. The approach follows the concept of domain adaptation, shifting the target domain samples into the domain knownto the object detector (source domain). Firstly, the UNIT network is trained for domain adaptation and subsequently cast into an online domain adaptation module, which narrows down the domain gap. Domain adaptation capabilities are evaluated qualitatively by displaying translated samples and visualizing the domain shift through the 2D tSNE algorithm. We quantitatively benchmark the domain adaptation's influence on a state-of-the-art object detector, and on a retrained object detector, for mean average precision, mean recall, and the resulting F1-score. Our approach achieves an F1 score improvement of 5.27 \% within object detection by night when applying online domain adaptation. The evaluation is executed on the BDD100K benchmark data set.},

  abstract = {Semantic segmentation has made striking progress due to the success of deep convolutional neural networks. Considering the demands of autonomous driving, real-time semantic segmentation has become a research hotspot these years. However, few real-time RGB-D fusion semantic segmentation studies are carried out despite readily accessible depth information nowadays. In this paper, we propose a real-time fusion semantic segmentation network termed RFNet that effectively exploits complementary cross-modal information. Building on an efficient network architecture, RFNet is capable of running swiftly, which satisfies autonomous vehicles applications. Multi-dataset training is leveraged to incorporate unexpected small obstacle detection, enriching the recognizable classes required to face unforeseen hazards in the real world. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework. On Cityscapes, Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art semantic segmenters, with excellent accuracy and 22Hz inference speed at the full 2048x1024 resolution, outperforming most existing RGB-D networks.}

However, it remains challenging to robustly estimate scene depth from the noisy and otherwise corrupted measurements recorded by a SPAD. Here, we propose a deep sensor fusion strategy that combines corrupted SPAD data and a conventional 2D image to estimate the depth of a scene. Our primary contribution is a neural network architecture---SPADnet---that uses a monocular depth estimation algorithm together with a SPAD denoising and sensor fusion strategy. This architecture, together with several techniques in network training, achieves state-of-the-art results for RGB-SPAD fusion with simulated and captured data. Moreover, SPADnet is more computationally efficient than previous RGB-SPAD fusion networks.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to simulate the functionality of a digital camera system. The simulations cover the conversion from light to numerical signal, color processing, and rendering. A spectral image processing algorithm is used to simulate the radiometric properties of a digital camera. In the algorithm, we take into consideration the spectral image and the transmittances of the light source, lenses, filters, and the quantum efficiency of a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. The optical part is characterized by a multiple convolution between the different point spread functions optical components such as the Cooke triplet, the aperture, the light fall off, and the optical part of the CMOS sensor. The electrical part consists of the Bayer sampling, interpolation, dynamic range, and analog to digital conversion. The reconstruction of the noisy blurred image is performed by blending different light exposed images in order to reduce the noise. Then, the image is filtered, deconvoluted, and sharpened to eliminate the noise and blur. Next, we have the color processing and rendering blocks interpolation, white balancing, color correction, conversion from XYZ color space to LAB color space, and, then, into the RGB color space, the color saturation and contrast.},

  abstract = {3D object detection is an essential task in autonomous driving. Recent techniques excel with highly accurate detection rates, provided the 3D input data is obtained from precise but expensive LiDAR technology. Approaches based on cheaper monocular or stereo imagery data have, until now, resulted in drastically lower accuracies --- a gap that is commonly attributed to poor image-based depth estimation. However, in this paper we argue that data representation (rather than its quality) accounts for the majority of the difference. Taking the inner workings of convolutional neural networks into consideration, we propose to convert image-based depth maps to pseudo-LiDAR representations --- essentially mimicking LiDAR signal. With this representation we can apply different existing LiDAR-based detection algorithms. On the popular KITTI benchmark, our approach achieves impressive improvements over the existing state-of-the-art in image-based performance --- raising the detection accuracy of objects within 30m range from the previous state-of-the-art of 22\% to an unprecedented 74\%. At the time of submission our algorithm holds the highest entry on the KITTI 3D object detection leaderboard for stereo image based approaches.}

  abstract = {The performance of RIT's Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) model is validated. The model is robust enough to treat solar, atmospheric, target/background, and sensor interactions. It operates over the 0.28 - 28 micrometers (Ultraviolet- Long Wavelength Infra-Red) spectral region. However, this study focuses only on the 0.4 - 1.0 micrometer (reflective) region. To validate the model, reference (actual) imagery from an airborne frame sensor is compared to synthetic imagery of the same scene. This study also evaluates DIRSIG's treatment of reflectivity and recommends improvements.},

  abstract = {Detecting objects such as cars and pedestrians in 3D plays an indispensable role in autonomous driving. Existing approaches largely rely on expensive LiDAR sensors for accurate depth information. While recently pseudo-LiDAR has been introduced as a promising alternative, at a much lower cost based solely on stereo images, there is still a notable performance gap. In this paper we provide substantial advances to the pseudo-LiDAR framework through improvements in stereo depth estimation. Concretely, we adapt the stereo network architecture and loss function to be more aligned with accurate depth estimation of faraway objects --- currently the primary weakness of pseudo-LiDAR. Further, we explore the idea to leverage cheaper but extremely sparse LiDAR sensors, which alone provide insufficient information for 3D detection, to de-bias our depth estimation. We propose a depth-propagation algorithm, guided by the initial depth estimates, to diffuse these few exact measurements across the entire depth map. We show on the KITTI object detection benchmark that our combined approach yields substantial improvements in depth estimation and stereo-based 3D object detection --- outperforming the previous state-of-the-art detection accuracy for faraway objects by 40\%. Our code is available at https://github.com/mileyan/Pseudo\_Lidar\_V2.}

Although depth sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect have facilitated easy acquisition of such depth information, the vast majority of images used in vision tasks do not contain depth information. In this paper, we show that augmenting RGB images with estimated depth can also improve the accuracy of both object detection and semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first exploit the recent success of depth estimation from monocular images and learn a deep depth estimation model. Then, we learn deep depth features from the estimated depth and combine with RGB features for object detection and semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose an RGB-D semantic segmentation method, which applies a multi-task training scheme: semantic label prediction and depth value regression. We test our methods on several data sets and demonstrate that incorporating information from estimated depth improves the performance of object detection and semantic segmentation remarkably.},

Our first contribution is the design and implementation of a scalable annotation system that can provide a comprehensive set of image labels for large-scale driving datasets. Our second contribution is a new driving dataset, facilitated by our tooling, which is an order of magnitude larger than previous efforts, and is comprised of over 100K videos with diverse kinds of annotations including image level tagging, object bounding boxes, drivable areas, lane markings, and full-frame instance segmentation. The dataset possesses geographic, environmental, and weather diversity, which is useful for training models so that they are less likely to be surprised by new conditions.

  abstract = {Artificial lighting at night (ALAN) produced by urban, industrial, and roadway lighting, as well as other sources, has dramatically increased in recent decades, especially in coastal environments that support dense human populations. Artificial ``lightscapes'' are characterized by distinct spatial, temporal, and spectral patterns that can alter natural patterns of light and dark with consequences across levels of biological organization. At the individual level, ALAN can elicit a suite of physiological and behavioral responses associated with light-mediated processes such as diel activity patterns and predator-prey interactions. ALAN has also been shown to modify community composition and trophic structure, with implications for ecosystem-level processes including primary productivity, nutrient cycling, and the energetic linkages between aquatic and terrestrial systems. Here, we review the state of the science relative to the impacts of ALAN on estuaries, which is an important step in assessing the long-term sustainability of coastal regions. We first consider how multiple properties of ALAN (e.g., intensity and spectral content) influence the interaction between physiology and behavior of individual estuarine biota (drawing from studies on invertebrates, fishes, and birds). Second, we link individual- to community- and ecosystem-level responses, with a focus on the impacts of ALAN on food webs and implications for estuarine ecosystem functions. Coastal aquatic communities and ecosystems have been identified as a key priority for ALAN research, and a cohesive research framework will be critical for understanding and mitigating ecological consequences.}

  abstract = {A complete simulation of a machine vision system aimed at defect inspection on a reflective surface is proposed by ray tracing. The simulated scene is composed of the camera model, surface reflectance property, and light intensity distribution along with their corresponding object geometries. A virtual reflective plane geometry with scratches of various directions and pits of various sizes is built as the sample. Its realistic image is obtained by Monte Carlo ray tracing. Compared to the pinhole camera model, the camera model with a finite aperture emits more rays to deliver physical imaging. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function is applied to describe the surface reflectance property. The illustrated machine vision system captures a number of images while translating the light tubes. Then the image sequence obtained by experiment or simulation is fused to generate a well-contrasted synthetic image for defect detection. A flexible fusion method based on differential images is introduced to enhance the defect contrast on a uniform flawless background. To improve detection efficiency, defect contrast of synthetic images obtained by various fusion methods is evaluated. Influence of total image number, light tube width, and fusion interval is further discussed to optimize the inspection process. Experiments on car painted surfaces have shown that the simulated parameters can instruct the setup of the optical system and detect surface defects efficiently. The proposed simulation is capable of saving great effort in carrying out experimental trials and making improvements on reflective surface defect inspection.},
