# Human cortical plasticity - MRI {#sec-cortical-development-plasticity}
{{< include "includes/WIP-callout.qmd" >}}

MR images of the infant brain and how it changes in the first six months.  The development of white matter.

Also, what we think is already there.  What scale is changing? What scale is largely in place?  Coarse to fine is the obvious point to make.

Some plasticity throughout the lifespan.  What is stable?  What is plastic.

Bring up the recent somatosensory studies.

Get the Baseler work on rod monochromats, showing the limitations of our first study, in here.  We had special cases and few studies.  The later study overturned what we believed.
