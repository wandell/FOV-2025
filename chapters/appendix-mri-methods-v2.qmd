## MRI methods overview {#sec-appendix-mri-overview}
It still seems miraculous that we can place a living human head in a strong magnetic field, apply carefully timed radiofrequency (RF) pulses and magnetic-field gradients, and reconstruct images that reflect brain structure and function. I have taught a course on the physics of MRI for nearly twenty years, but the basic idea continues to thrill me. As Arthur C. Clarke put it in his third law, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”

MRI was first adopted as a clinical tool, and it has also become essential in visual neuroscience for several reasons. First, MRI can be used to measure signals related to neural activity in the living human brain, including while participants perform visual tasks (functional MRI, or fMRI). Second, the method is considered safe for repeated measurements under standard clinical and research guidelines, allowing the same individual to be studied in depth across multiple sessions. Third, MRI can resolve structure and function at the scale of small volume elements (“voxels”) that are often around a cubic millimeter or less, providing finer spatial detail than many other noninvasive methods for studying the living human brain.

An MR scanner can be programmed in many ways, enabling it to measure different signals from tissue. Early MRI methods produced “static” structural images with contrast that distinguishes major tissue classes, including gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Newer methods measure signals associated with neural activity (fMRI). These measurements have been transformative, even though the hemodynamic response they rely on is slow: after a brief change in neural activity, the fMRI signal typically evolves over several seconds and returns to baseline over roughly 5–10 seconds. This combination of spatial resolution and temporal dynamics makes fMRI well suited to some experimental designs, but less suitable to others. With other pulse sequences, MRI can measure how water diffusion depends on direction; these diffusion measurements can be used to estimate features of white matter microstructure and to infer the trajectories of major fiber pathways.

In the sections below I first describe the instrument, which is best thought of as a tightly integrated set of subsystems. I then describe the fundamental MR signal (the free induction decay) and connect it to two key physical processes: longitudinal recovery (T1) and transverse decay (T2). By designing different pulse sequences, the scanner can emphasize one process or the other, allowing investigators to probe different tissue properties. Turning raw scanner signals into images also requires substantial signal processing, along with additional steps to correct for instrument imperfections and calibrate the measurements. The conversion from the scanner’s native data format into the images used for scientific and clinical interpretation is a central part of MRI technology.

This chapter provides a brief overview of MR instrumentation and core ideas, with the goal of helping visual neuroscientists develop intuition for what MRI measures and why. Readers who want to go further will find many excellent textbooks and tutorials; I will also share lectures from my course for those who would like a more detailed (and more enthusiastic) tour of these ideas.

## MRI instrumentation
It is easy to understand why most people who think of the MR system in terms of the large magnet that provides the high uniform magnetic field (called the **B0 field**). After all, that is the place the participant enters to be measured, and it is housed in the **scanner room**.

![An MRI scanner comprises several intertwined systems. The image of the **scanner room** shows the scanner itself, and a participant on a bed that is about to slide into the bore of magnet. The large steady magnet has a cylindrical opening that the bed slides into. The magnetic field is maintained by a current that flows through super-conducting wires, kept at very low temperature (4.3 Kelvin) by liquid hydrogen. Many other critical components, described below, are housed within the plastic cover. The **machine room** is adjacent to the scanner and has electronic and mechanical gear that controls the actions of the RF coils and gradients. The room also contains pumps for chilled water to remove heat, and special purpose panels that allow signals to enter and leave the scanner room without disturbing the signals. The experimenter will sit in the **control room** that has the computer whose program controls the the RF coils and spatial gradient coils.  The computer also receives the MR data, reconstructing it into the images that are shown on the monitor.](images/appendix/mri/mr-scanner.png){#fig-mr-scanner}

Although we refer to this part as the main magnet, in fact beneath the plastic housing there are several distinct components that must work together to create the signal and the images. Wrapped around the fixed magnet there are special purpose coils that introduce spatial gradients into the uniform B0 field. There are also special purpose coils that transmit and receive radio frequency (RF) pulses. These RF pulses evoke and then measure the signal that is emitted from the brain (or other substrate).

Josh Wilson and I wrote a lot of slides in Psych 204a class discussion about this.  I also added a Google doc in docs (explanations) in that directory.
